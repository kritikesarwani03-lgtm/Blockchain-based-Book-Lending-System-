# Blockchain-based Book Lending System

## Description of the Project

The Blockchain-based Book Lending System is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables peer-to-peer book sharing without intermediaries. This innovative platform allows book owners to list their books for lending with customizable fees, while readers can easily borrow available books through secure blockchain transactions.

The smart contract consists of two core functions:
- **`list_book()`**: Enables book owners to register their books on the platform with a title and lending fee
- **`borrow_book()`**: Allows users to borrow available books, automatically updating the ownership status

Built using Move programming language, the system ensures transparency, immutability, and trustless interactions between book owners and borrowers. Each book is represented as a unique resource with metadata including title, owner information, availability status, and lending terms.

## Vision of the Project

Our vision is to create a **global, decentralized library ecosystem** where knowledge sharing transcends geographical boundaries and traditional lending limitations. We aim to:

- **Democratize access to books** by removing barriers between book owners and readers worldwide
- **Empower book owners** to monetize their personal libraries while contributing to community knowledge sharing
- **Build a trustless system** where transactions are secure, transparent, and don't require intermediary institutions
- **Foster a global reading community** connected through blockchain technology
- **Preserve and promote literacy** by making books more accessible and affordable through direct peer-to-peer lending

The ultimate goal is to transform how we think about book ownership and sharing, moving from a scarcity-based model to an abundance-based ecosystem where every book can reach its maximum potential readership.

## Future Scope of the Project
